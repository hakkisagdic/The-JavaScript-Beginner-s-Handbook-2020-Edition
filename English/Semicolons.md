
## Semicolons
Every line in a JavaScript program is optionally terminated using semicolons.

I said optionally, because the JavaScript interpreter is smart enough to introduce semicolons for you.

In most cases, you can omit semicolons altogether from your programs without even thinking about it.

This fact is very controversial. Some developers will always use semicolons, some others will never use semicolons, and you'll always find code that uses semicolons and code that does not.

My personal preference is to avoid semicolons, so my examples in the book will not include them.
