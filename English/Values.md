## Values

A `hello` string is a **value**.
A number like `12` is a **value**.

`hello` and `12` are values. `string` and `number` are the **types** of those values.

The **type** is the kind of value, its category. We have many different types in JavaScript, and we'll talk about them in detail later on. Each type has its own characteristics.

When we need to have a reference to a value, we assign it to a **variable**.
The variable can have a name, and the value is what's stored in a variable, so we can later access that value through the variable name.
