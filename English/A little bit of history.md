## A little bit of history
Created in 1995, JavaScript has gone a very long way since its humble beginnings.

It was the first scripting language that was supported natively by web browsers, and thanks to this it gained a competitive advantage over any other language and today it's still the only scripting language that we can use to build Web Applications.

Other languages exist, but all must compile to JavaScript - or more recently to WebAssembly, but this is another story.

In the begining, JavaScript was not nearly powerful as it is today, and it was mainly used for fancy animations and the marvel known at the time as Dynamic HTML.

With the growing needs that the web platform demanded (and continues to demand), JavaScript had the responsibility to grow as well, to accommodate the needs of one of the most widely used ecosystems of the world.

JavaScript is also now widely used outside of the browser. The rise of Node.js in the last few years unlocked backend development, once the domain of Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, and more traditional server-side languages.

JavaScript is now also the language powering databases and many more applications, and it's even possible to develop embedded applications, mobile apps, TV apps, and much more. What started as a tiny language inside the browser is now the most popular language in the world.
